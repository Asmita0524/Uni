<h3 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">Prehistoric and primitive cultures</h3>
<p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 28px; text-align: center;">The term education can be applied to primitive cultures only in the sense of enculturation, which is the process of cultural transmission. A primitive person, whose culture is the totality of his universe, has a relatively fixed sense of cultural continuity and timelessness. The model of life is relatively static and absolute, and it is transmitted from one generation to another with little deviation.</p>

<h3> Education in classical cultures</h3>
<h4>Ancient India<br>
The Hindu tradition</h4>
<p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">
 India is the site of one of the most ancient civilizations in the world. The Indo-European-speaking peoples who entered India in the 2nd millennium BCE established large-scale settlements and founded powerful kingdoms. In the course of time, a group of intellectuals, the Brahmans, became priests and men of learning; another group, of nobles and soldiers, became the Kshatriyas; the agricultural and trading class was called the Vaishyas; and artisans and labourers became the Shudra.

<h4> Indian influences on Asia</h4>
<p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><b> - </b>
An account of Indian education during the ancient period would be incomplete without a discussion of the influence of Indian culture on Sri Lanka and Central and Southeast Asia.<br>
 It was achieved partly through cultural or trade relations and partly through political influence. Khotan, in Central Asia, had a famous Buddhist vihara as early as the 1st century CE.<br> 
 A number of Indian scholars lived there, and many Chinese pilgrims remained there instead of going to India. Indian pandits (scholars) were also invited to China and Tibet, and many Chinese and Tibetan monks studied in Buddhist viharas in India.<p></div>

<h4>Scholarship under the Han (206 BCE–220 CE)</h4>
<p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><b> - </b>
 The Han dynasty reversed many of the policies of its short-lived predecessor. The most important change was a shift from Legalism to Confucianism. The banned books were now highly regarded, and the classics became the core of education. An assiduous effort was made to recover the prohibited books and to discover books and manuscripts that scholars had concealed in secret places. Much painstaking work was done in copying and editing, and the textual and interpretative studies of the Han scholars accorded a new importance to the study of the classics. .</p></div>

<h4> Higher education</h4>
<p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">A system of higher education open to all—to all, at any rate, who had the leisure and necessary money—emerged with the appearance of the Sophists, mostly foreign teachers who were contemporaries and adversaries of Socrates (c. 470–399 BCE). Until then the higher forms of culture had retained an esoteric character, being transmitted by the master to a few chosen disciples—as in the first schools of medicine at Cnidus and at Cos—or within the framework of a religious confraternity involving initiate status.
